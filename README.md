# Pipeline CI/CD

<b>Imagine you have a cake recipe that you want to share with your friends. But instead of making the whole cake for each friend, you set up a production line:

1. You write the recipe on paper (this is like writing the program code).

2. Every time you make a change to the recipe (like “add less sugar”), a helper in the kitchen quickly checks if the recipe still makes sense and if the cake will turn out good (this is Continuous Integration, or CI). They test every change before sending it to production.

3. When the recipe is perfect, another helper starts making the cake automatically, without needing your help (this is Continuous Delivery, or CD).

4. Once the cake is ready, it gets delivered to your friends quickly, as soon as it’s done (this is Continuous Deployment, or another part of CD).

The cool thing about CI/CD is that you can update the recipe, test the cake, and deliver it to your friends multiple times in a single day without starting from scratch each time. It’s an efficient and fast way to ensure everyone always gets a delicious cake whenever you come up with a new idea! 🎂</b>
